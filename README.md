# 🌀 Particle Simulation – Mouse Reactive 🎯

A fun and interactive particle simulation built with **Python** and **Pygame**. Particles bounce around the screen, influenced by physics like gravity and friction. Move your mouse to see the particles react — they get **repelled** from your cursor like a force field!
